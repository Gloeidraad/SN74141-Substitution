The SN74141 is an obsolete device intended for diving nixie tubes. However, even today, enthusiasts still love nixie tubes. Sometimes by building digital clock with nixies, but also keeping vintage equivalent alive. In the old days, very often the nixie tubes are driven by the good old SN74141 device. These devices (or the soviet K155ID1) can still be found on the internet, but stocks are dwindling. I tried to make a replacement circuit which should fit in the location of the original DIL-16 footprint of the SN74141. 
Because of the limited size of the DIL-16 socket, I had to use the smallest devices possible, so if you want the use the design, be sure you are capable to solder TSSOP devices. 
The design is not implement on a real PCBA yet, so please test it yourself before placing it in al valuable instrument.
